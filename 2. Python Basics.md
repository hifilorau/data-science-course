Starting with Python Syntax and Data Types
Python is known for its simplicity and readability, making it an excellent language for beginners. Let's start by discussing Python syntax and basic data types.

### Python Syntax:

Python syntax is clean and easy to read.
Python uses indentation to define blocks of code.
Comments are marked by #.

### Basic Data Types:

Integers: Whole numbers, e.g., 5, 100.
Floats: Decimal numbers, e.g., 3.14, 2.0.
Strings: Text, e.g., "Hello, World!".
Lists: Ordered, mutable collections, e.g., [1, 2, 3].
Dictionaries: Key-value pairs, e.g., {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}.

### Activity
#### Exercise 1: Python Basics
#### Objective: Get familiar with Python syntax, variables, and basic data types.

Task:
Create variables of different data types (integer, float, string, list, dictionary).
Perform basic operations: add two numbers, concatenate strings, append an element to a list, and add a key-value pair to a dictionary.
Print the results.

# Integer and Float
num1 = 10
num2 = 5.5
print("Sum:", num1 + num2)

# String
str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "World"
print("Concatenated String:", str1 + " " + str2)

# List
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list1.append(4)
print("List after appending:", list1)

# Dictionary
dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
dict1['c'] = 3
print("Dictionary with new key-value pair:", dict1)

#### Exercise 2: Control Structures
#### Objective: Understand and implement Python's control structures.

Task:
Write a script that checks if a number (e.g., num = 10) is even or odd.
Implement a for loop that iterates over a list and prints each element.
Use a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.

# Integer and Float
num1 = 10
num2 = 5.5
print("Sum:", num1 + num2)

# String
str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "World"
print("Concatenated String:", str1 + " " + str2)

# List
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list1.append(4)
print("List after appending:", list1)

# Dictionary
dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
dict1['c'] = 3
print("Dictionary with new key-value pair:", dict1)

### Exercise 3: Functions and Modules
#### Objective: Learn to define functions and use Python modules.

Task:
Define a function add_numbers that takes two arguments and returns their sum.
Import the math module and use its sqrt function to calculate the square root of a number.

# Function to add numbers
def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y

print("Sum:", add_numbers(3, 7))

# Using the math module
import math
print("Square root of 16:", math.sqrt(16))

Running the Exercises
Open your Jupyter Notebook.
Copy the code for each exercise into separate cells.
Execute the cells and observe the output.
These exercises are designed to give you hands-on experience with basic Python concepts. Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different values or scenarios. Once you're comfortable with these basics, you'll be well-prepared to tackle more advanced Python programming challenges in data science.
