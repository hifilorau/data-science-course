# Project/Quiz for Chapter 3
## Part 1: Practical Tasks

### NumPy Exercise:

1. Create a NumPy array of 10 random integers between 1 and 100.
1. Calculate and print the mean, median, and standard deviation of the array.

### Pandas Exercise:

1. Load a dataset of your choice into a Pandas DataFrame. (You can use sns.load_dataset('dataset_name') if you need a dataset.)
1. Perform the following data manipulations:
1. Filter the rows where a specific column's value is greater than a certain threshold.
1. Group the data by a categorical column and calculate the mean of another column.
1. Create a new column that is derived from existing columns (e.g., the sum of two columns).

### Data Visualization Exercise:

1. Using the same dataset as in the Pandas exercise, create a plot of your choice (line plot, scatter plot, histogram, etc.) using Matplotlib or Seaborn.
1. Ensure the plot has a title, axis labels, and a legend if necessary.

## Part 2: Conceptual Questions

1. What is the difference between a NumPy array and a list in Python? Why is NumPy preferred in data science?

1. Explain the difference between the loc and iloc methods in Pandas.

1. Why is it important to clean and preprocess data before analysis or modeling?

1. What are some common data preprocessing steps?

1. Describe one situation where a scatter plot would be more useful than a bar chart and why.
