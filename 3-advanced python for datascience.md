### Starting with NumPy and Pandas
Since you've already had some experience with Pandas, let's start with an introduction to NumPy, another critical library in Python for data science.

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

### NumPy Basics:

#### 1. Array Creation and Operations:

Understanding NumPy arrays.
Basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.

#### 2. Array Indexing and Slicing:

Accessing and modifying array elements.
Slicing arrays.

#### 3. Statistical Functions:

Common functions: mean, median, std, var.

#### 4. Linear Algebra in NumPy:

Basic linear algebra operations: dot product, matrix multiplication.
Practical Exercise:
Try creating a NumPy array, perform basic operations, and use some of the statistical functions mentioned.


###  Data Manipulation and Cleaning

#### Tasks and Topics:

1. Handling missing data: Techniques like imputation, dropping rows/columns.
1. Data transformation: Methods such as normalization and scaling.
1. String operations and regular expressions: Manipulating text data, extracting patterns.

#### Practical Exercise:
1. Work with a dataset to identify and handle missing values.
1. Normalize a numerical column in the dataset.

###  Introduction to APIs and Web Scraping

#### Tasks and Topics:

1. Fetching data from APIs: Understanding how to use APIs to gather data.
1. Basics of web scraping using Python: Extracting data from websites with libraries like Beautiful Soup.

#### Practical Exercise:

1.Write a Python script to fetch data from a public API.
1. Create a simple web scraper to extract information from a webpage.

### File Operations in Python

#### Tasks and Topics:

1. Reading and writing different file formats: Working with CSV, JSON, and Excel files.
1. Handling large datasets: Techniques for efficient data processing.

#### Practical Exercise:

Read data from a CSV file and write the processed data to a new JSON file.
