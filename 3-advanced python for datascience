### Starting with NumPy and Pandas
Since you've already had some experience with Pandas, let's start with an introduction to NumPy, another critical library in Python for data science.

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

### NumPy Basics:

#### 1. Array Creation and Operations:

Understanding NumPy arrays.
Basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.

#### 2. Array Indexing and Slicing:

Accessing and modifying array elements.
Slicing arrays.

#### 3. Statistical Functions:

Common functions: mean, median, std, var.

#### 4. Linear Algebra in NumPy:

Basic linear algebra operations: dot product, matrix multiplication.
Practical Exercise:
Try creating a NumPy array, perform basic operations, and use some of the statistical functions mentioned.
